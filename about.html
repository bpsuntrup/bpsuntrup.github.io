<h1>About</h1>

<p>I figured out how to internet, and this is what I did. </p>

<p>This website is hosted by Vultr. Here's my affiliate link: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8561438-6G">Affiliated Vultr Link</a></p>

<p>If you use this link, you'll get 100 dollars, and I'll get 25. So, that's
pretty cool. </p>

<p>But really, it's not that exciting, because they'll just take the "promotional credit" back after a couple of months. 
I've never really heard of this before. Frankly, it's a pretty shady practice. My recommendation is to stay away from
Vultr.</p>

<p>This website is also brought to you by NGINX, with whom I have no affiliation. </p>

<p>Also by Perl5, which is used to build these pages using a combination of
Template Toolkit and Markdown.... It's pretty awful. It's awful pretty.</p>

<p>Also by viewers like you. Thank you.</p>
