<h1>My son got bit by a turtle.</h1>

<p>That was... interesting. He still has all of his fingers.</p>

<h2>Saturday routine</h2>

<p>I should have a Saturday routine. It should start after breakfast.</p>

<p>I have a lot of work to do. I want to grow my own food.</p>

<p>I've decided that most of my food should be based on animals. I've
tried eating plants. Plants suck (as food). Plants are what my food
eats. </p>

<p>Some plants are good though. I want to grow greens, carrots, potatoes,
onions, and tomatoes. I think that's probably enough plants. </p>

<p>The rest of my food will be chickens, chicken eggs, rabbits, and maybe
swine. I'd like to grow some of my own red meat. I'm not good at hunting.
If I knew for a fact that I would be able to kill a deer every year, I
might not worry about breeding red meat. I'd like a flock of goats. eventually.</p>

<p>Maybe even sheep. </p>

<p>Or maybe sheep and goats.</p>

<p>I have to mow grass in the summer. That should be a part of my routine too.
I like to do that on Friday, though. </p>

<p>A Saturday routine (for starters) doesn't have to be all-encompassing.
The most important thing is having some kind of structure to the day.
I tend to feel totally lost without day structure.</p>

<p>I should probably keep a to do list of things to... do around the farm.
Then part of my routine can be grooming the to do list. </p>

<p>I should probably check the mail on Saturdays. </p>

<p>I should probably balance the finances on Saturdays. </p>

<p>I should probably count my ammo, clean my assault rifles, sharpen my
Bowie knives, and re-apply poison to my darts on Saturdays. Also a
good day to check all my locks and tune my chainsaw booby traps. </p>

<p>I'll start with the following Saturday routine after breakfast:</p>

<ul>
<li>balance finances</li>
<li>groom to do list</li>
<li>get mail</li>
</ul>
